# StudentsDataBase

In this project I made form that gets value from input and writes it to a object of student
Then function getStudentItem() prints students in the table.

Also, I made a small search by surname and faculty.

In the table I made a couple filters by Surname and faculty.

Students' age is calculated by funtion calculateAge();
Also, birthdays are formatted by function formatDate();
